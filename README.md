<sup>look at ej he's so cute </sup>

**"I was staring face to face with a creature with a black hoodie and a dark blue mask with no nose or mouth staring down at me. The thing that scared me the most was that it had no eyes. Just empty, black sockets. _The creature also had some black substance dripping from its sockets._"**
